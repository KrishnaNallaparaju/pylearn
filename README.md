COMMENTS:
--------
In python, we have only a Single line comment.  eg :  #This is Single line comment
*No block comments avalable for the python.

Variable:
-------
*No need of define the data type of the variable.
my_var = "My name is Krishna"

STRING MANPULATIONS:
-------------------
* Behind the scenes, the strings were represented by single quotes in python.
* But the programmer can use the single or doble quotes as per the visualization!
* Multi line strings '''       xyz \n \n         '''
* Addition operator:     "pass" + "word"  ->   'password'
* Multiplication operator:   "pass" * 4 ->  'passpasspasspass'

EVERYTHING IN THE PYTHON IS AN OBJECT (which has some state and methos() to deal with!)

* "my_name".find('n')   ->   3
* "my_name".find('me')  ->   5

BOOLEANS:
--------
Booleans in the python are used to test the "Truthness" of the variable!  

'True'   or   'False'

We can check the Boolean value for any object in Python by using the bool function. 
>>> bool('Hi')
True
